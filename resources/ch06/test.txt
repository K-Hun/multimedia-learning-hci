Trying to figure out whether we humans are alone in the world.
Creating life on other planets.
Which organization funded the project SETI?
NATO
NSA
NASA
ANSI
How are SETI centers around the world going to find extra-terrestrial life?
Sending air crafts outside the atmosphere of the earth.
Capturing radio signals.
Organizing special search teams.
Processing big data using large computers.
What is the most popular form of the SETI research?
Wave SETI
Macro SETI
Radio SETI
Spectrum SETI
What does a radio telescope look like?
An enormous dish with a very sensitive antenna
An enormous antenna
A telescope placed above an enormous dish
A very sensitive and huge telescope
Where is the world’s largest radio telescope?
In the country of Portugal
In the city of Prague
On the island of Puerto Rico
In the state of Pennsylvania
What is the radio signal capturing range of the largest radio telescope in the world?
From 1,000 feet above the earth’s surface to 4,000 feet above the atmosphere.
From the earth’s surface to 1,000,000 light years.
From the earth’s atmosphere to 1,000 light years.
From the earth’s atmosphere to 100 Million light years.
Which statement is true about the data collected from SETI projects around the world?
They are a huge amount of data that no single computer can manage its processing.
These data, reveal the location of the aliens on other planets.
They are the signals that the aliens have sent us.
They are collected from the largest radio telescope of the world.
What was the reason that the SETI researchers thought about using personal computers’ processing power?
Because they didn’t have enough money to process the data themselves.
Because people wanted to contribute in the project.
Because separating and extracting the required data from the received signals require huge
processing power
Because they wanted to share the project’s data with individuals
What is the overall process of SETI@home distributed computing?
A small amount of data is downloaded and processed by each PC and then the result is
returned back to the headquarters in California.
All the data is sent to each PC and after the processing is done, the results are returned to
the headquarters in California.
The same data is sent to each PC, and the results of each one are compared to the results of
the others to see if there are any mistakes in the computations.
One very large computer does all the required computations, and then the results are sent to
distributed PCs for validation
Why is it required to separate the signals that might possibly be signs of extra-terrestrial life from the received signals?
Because there are noises in the received signals that have to be cleaned.
Because separating the signals, causes the reduction of the data size.
Because other planets, stars and galaxies also emit radio signals.
Because the signals are composed of different frequency bands.
What is this pod cast generally about?
It explains how distributed computing has helped the project SETI.
It talks about radio telescopes that are used to receive radio signals.
It talks about life outside the solar system and how human is searching for them.
It is about the aliens that have been found throughout the SETI project.
